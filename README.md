# Named-Pipes-in-Linux-C
This is a simple Program inter-process communication between two different programs in the same machine,using the method of named pipes.This program acts like a messaging application,when the other program writes the other will read and VICE-VERSA until either side terminated by user then communication will be jammed.This simple application runs on Linux, to run it you should open two console terminals and execute one program on another and the other program on the other and make sure to start execution with the first program.NOTE: when ever either screen is showing WRITE user should input message.
